# Contributing to MCP Servers

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how you can help make this repo better.

We accept changes through [the standard GitHub flow model](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).

## Server Listings

We welcome PRs that add links to your servers in the [README.md](./README.md)!

## Server Implementations

We welcome:
- **Bug fixes** — Help us squash those pesky bugs.
- **Usability improvements** — Making servers easier to use for humans and agents.
- **Enhancements that demonstrate MCP protocol features** — We encourage contributions that help reference servers better illustrate underutilized aspects of the MCP protocol beyond just Tools, such as Resources, Prompts, or Roots. For example, adding Roots support to filesystem-server helps showcase this important but lesser-known feature.

We're more selective about:
- **Other new features** — Especially if they're not crucial to the server's core purpose or are highly opinionated. The existing servers are reference servers meant to inspire the community. If you need specific features, we encourage you to build enhanced versions! We think a diverse ecosystem of servers is beneficial for everyone, and would love to link to your improved server in our README.

We don't accept:
- **New server implementations** — We encourage you to publish them yourself, and link to them from the README.

## Documentation

Improvements to existing documentation is welcome - although generally we'd prefer ergonomic improvements than documenting pain points if possible!

We're more selective about adding wholly new documentation, especially in ways that aren't vendor neutral (e.g. how to run a particular server with a particular client).
